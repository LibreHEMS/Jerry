# Jerry AI - Security Configuration

## Security Principles

### 1. Zero Trust Architecture
- All inter-service communication requires authentication
- No service trusts any other service by default
- All requests are validated and authorized

### 2. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security controls
- Input validation at all boundaries
- Output sanitization for all responses

### 3. Least Privilege
- Services run with minimal required permissions
- Container security context restrictions
- File system permissions locked down

### 4. Secure by Default
- All security features enabled by default
- Fail-safe configurations
- Security-first design decisions

## Implementation Checklist

### Container Security
- [x] Non-root user execution
- [x] Read-only filesystem where possible
- [x] Resource limits configured
- [x] Security scanning enabled
- [x] Minimal base images

### Network Security
- [x] Inter-service TLS encryption
- [x] Network segmentation
- [x] Firewall rules configured
- [x] No unnecessary port exposure

### Application Security
- [x] Input validation on all endpoints
- [x] Output sanitization
- [x] SQL injection prevention
- [x] XSS protection
- [x] CSRF protection

### Authentication & Authorization
- [x] JWT token validation
- [x] API key authentication
- [x] Role-based access control
- [x] Session management
- [x] Token expiration

### Data Protection
- [x] Encryption at rest
- [x] Encryption in transit
- [x] Secrets management
- [x] PII protection
- [x] Audit logging

### Monitoring & Incident Response
- [x] Security event logging
- [x] Anomaly detection
- [x] Incident response procedures
- [x] Security metrics collection
- [x] Alerting configuration
