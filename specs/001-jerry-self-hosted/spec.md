# Feature Specification: Jerry Self-Hosted AI Migration

**Feature Branch**: `001-jerry-self-hosted`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Jerry Self-Hosted AI: Spek - This document outlines the constitution, plan, and tasks for transitioning the "Jerry" AI advisor into a fully self-hosted, containerized, and enhanced platform."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an operator wanting to deploy Jerry AI advisor, I need to migrate from the current Deno-based application to a fully self-hosted Python-based containerized platform with a secure web interface, that preserves Jerry's persona while adding agentic capabilities, knowledge base integration, and enhanced security.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the new Python platform is deployed, **When** a user interacts with the web interface, **Then** Jerry maintains his grandfatherly Australian energy advisor persona in all interactions.
2. **Given** the containerized platform, **When** I deploy it using podman-compose, **Then** all services (web server, API, LLM, vector DB) start independently and communicate securely.
3. **Given** a user sends a message through the web interface, **When** the new system processes the request, **Then** Jerry responds using the local LLM with agentic capabilities including web research and knowledge base retrieval.
4. **Given** the web interface is accessed, **When** a user attempts to connect, **Then** they are authenticated and authorized through a secure tunnel.
5. **Given** the knowledge base is populated, **When** a user asks about Australian energy standards, **Then** Jerry provides accurate, contextual advice using RAG pipeline.
6. **Given** the system is running, **When** monitored over time, **Then** performance metrics show efficient resource utilization and response times.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the local LLM service is unavailable?
- How does the system handle knowledge base corruption or unavailability?
- What occurs during conversation context overflow?
- How are authentication failures handled in the secure tunnel?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST preserve Jerry's grandfatherly, knowledgeable, patient persona in all interactions.
- **FR-002**: System MUST be fully self-hosted with no dependencies on external proprietary services.
- **FR-003**: System MUST use open-source components for all functionality.
- **FR-004**: System MUST be container-native using Podman orchestration.
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a web-based chat interface for user interaction.
- **FR-006**: System MUST integrate a local Large Language Model for text generation.
- **FR-007**: System MUST implement agentic capabilities using LangChain for conversation management.
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a RAG pipeline with a vector database for knowledge retrieval.
- **FR-009**: System MUST implement secure networking for service communication.
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide monitoring and performance optimization capabilities.
- **FR-011**: System MUST support progressive conversation summarization for efficient context management.
- **FR-012**: System MUST implement semantic caching for improved response times.
- **FR-013**: System MUST follow test-driven development with comprehensive coverage.
- **FR-014**: System MUST use modern Python tooling (uv, ruff) for the development workflow.
- **FR-015**: System MUST be protected by a secure tunnel that handles user authentication and authorization.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Web Interface**: Handles user interactions and message rendering.
- **API Service**: FastAPI backend that orchestrates requests between the web interface and other services.
- **Model Service**: Abstract interface for AI model interactions with a local LLM implementation.
- **LangChain Agent**: Manages conversation state, prompts, and tool orchestration.
- **Vector Database**: Stores knowledge base embeddings for RAG retrieval.
- **Knowledge Base**: Collection of Australian energy standards, product manuals, and articles.
- **Conversation History**: User interaction records with privacy and summarization management.
- **Monitoring System**: Performance metrics, alerts, and system health tracking.
- **Auth Tunnel**: Secure entry point for authenticating and authorizing users.
