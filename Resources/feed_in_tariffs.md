# Understanding Feed-in Tariffs

A feed-in tariff (FiT) is a payment you receive for any excess electricity your solar system generates and sends back to the grid.

## How it Works

1.  **Self-Consumption:** Your home will first use the electricity generated by your solar panels. This is the most financially beneficial use of your solar power, as it saves you from buying electricity from the grid at a higher rate.
2.  **Export to the Grid:** If your system is generating more electricity than your home is using, the surplus is "exported" to the electricity grid.
3.  **Receive a Credit:** Your electricity retailer will pay you a set rate for each kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity you export. This payment appears as a credit on your electricity bill.

## FiT Rates

-   **Rates Vary:** Feed-in tariff rates are not fixed across Australia. They vary between states, territories, and electricity retailers.
-   **Retailer Competition:** Retailers compete on FiT rates, so it's worth shopping around. However, a high FiT rate might be paired with a higher daily supply charge or consumption rate, so always compare the entire electricity plan.
-   **Time-of-Day Tariffs:** Some retailers offer "time-varying" feed-in tariffs, where you get paid more for exporting electricity during peak demand periods (usually late afternoon and early evening). This can be beneficial if you have a west-facing system that generates more power in the afternoon.

## The Role of Batteries

A home battery system allows you to store your excess solar energy instead of exporting it to the grid. You can then use this stored energy in the evening, further reducing your reliance on the grid.

-   **Financial Viability:** While battery prices are decreasing, the payback period can still be long. The decision to add a battery often depends on your energy usage patterns and desire for energy independence, not just the feed-in tariff rate.
-   **Virtual Power Plants (VPPs):** Some electricity retailers offer VPP programs where you can get paid extra for allowing the retailer to draw power from your battery during peak grid demand. This can improve the financial return of a battery system.
