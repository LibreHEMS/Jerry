# A Consumer's Guide to Household Solar

This guide provides an overview for Australian homeowners looking to install a solar panel (PV) system for their homes.

## 1. Why Go Solar?

-   **Reduce Electricity Bills:** Generate your own free electricity from the sun.
-   **Increase Property Value:** A solar system can be an attractive feature for potential buyers.
-   **Lower Carbon Footprint:** Reduce your household's impact on the environment.
-   **Energy Independence:** Less reliance on the grid and protection from rising electricity prices.

## 2. Key Components of a Solar PV System

-   **Solar Panels:** Convert sunlight into DC electricity.
-   **Inverter:** Converts DC electricity from the panels into AC electricity that your home can use.
-   **Mounting System:** Secures the panels to your roof.
-   **Monitoring System:** Tracks your system's performance, often via a smartphone app.

## 3. Sizing Your System

The right system size depends on:

-   **Your Energy Consumption:** Look at your quarterly electricity bills (measured in kWh). A higher bill means you'll need a larger system.
-   **Your Roof Space:** The amount of available, unshaded roof space will limit the system size. North-facing roofs are ideal in Australia.
-   **Your Budget:** System costs vary by size and component quality.

A common system size for a family home in Australia is 6.6kW, but it can range from 3kW to over 10kW.

## 4. Finding a Reputable Installer

This is the most critical step. A poor installation can lead to underperformance and safety issues.

-   **Use a Clean Energy Council (CEC) Accredited Installer:** This is non-negotiable. The CEC is Australia's peak body for clean energy, and their accreditation ensures the installer meets industry best practices.
-   **Get Multiple Quotes:** Obtain at least three detailed quotes from different installers.
-   **Check Reviews and References:** Look for independent reviews online and ask for references from previous customers.
-   **Avoid High-Pressure Sales Tactics:** Be wary of "limited time offers" or salespeople who pressure you to sign on the spot.

## 5. Understanding Your Quote

A good quote should include:

-   **System Size:** The total capacity of the solar panels (e.g., 6.6kW).
-   **Component Details:** The brand, model, and warranty for both the panels and the inverter.
-   **Installation Details:** An estimated installation date and details of the work to be performed.
-   **Full Cost Breakdown:** Including the price of components, installation, and any grid connection fees.
-   **Performance Estimate:** A projection of how much electricity the system will generate.
-   **Government Rebate:** The quote should clearly show the point-of-sale discount from the federal Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES).

## 6. Government Incentives

The main incentive for small-scale solar in Australia is the SRES. This provides an upfront discount on the cost of your system. The value of the rebate depends on the size of your system and your location. Your installer will handle the paperwork for this and apply it as a discount to your quote.

Some state and territory governments may offer additional rebates or interest-free loans. Check your local government's energy website for current offers.
