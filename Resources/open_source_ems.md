# Open Source Energy Management Systems

This document provides a brief overview of some open-source projects relevant to home energy management.

## Home Assistant

-   **What it is:** Home Assistant is a powerful open-source home automation platform that puts local control and privacy first. It can integrate with thousands of different smart home devices and services.
-   **Energy Management:** Home Assistant has a dedicated Energy Dashboard that can track your home's electricity consumption, solar production, and gas usage. It can help you identify which devices are using the most energy and when.
-   **Integration:** It can integrate directly with many solar inverters, smart meters, and energy monitoring hardware to provide real-time data.
-   **Use Case for Jerry:** Jerry can provide advice on how to use Home Assistant to monitor and optimize energy usage, for example, by creating automations that run high-consumption appliances (like a dishwasher or pool pump) during peak solar generation hours.

## EMHASS (Energy Management for Home Assistant)

-   **What it is:** EMHASS is an add-on for Home Assistant that provides advanced energy management capabilities. It uses optimization and machine learning to make intelligent decisions about when to use, store, or export energy.
-   **Key Features:**
    -   **Day-ahead Optimization:** It plans your energy usage for the next 24 hours based on solar forecasts, your expected consumption, and electricity tariff information.
    -   **Battery Control:** It can intelligently charge and discharge a home battery to maximize self-consumption and minimize cost.
    -   **Load Shifting:** It can control smart plugs and other devices to shift energy-intensive tasks to the most optimal times.
-   **Use Case for Jerry:** For advanced users, Jerry can explain the concepts behind EMHASS and guide them through the setup process, helping them to fine-tune the system for their specific needs.

## ioBroker

-   **What it is:** ioBroker is another open-source IoT platform similar to Home Assistant. It has a strong user base, particularly in Europe.
-   **Features:** It offers a wide range of "adapters" to integrate with different systems, including many solar and energy-related products. It has a visual programming interface (Blockly) that can make creating automations easier for some users.
-   **Use Case for Jerry:** Jerry can mention ioBroker as an alternative to Home Assistant for users who might be looking for different features or a different user experience.
